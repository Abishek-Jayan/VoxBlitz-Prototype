# VoxBlitz (Status: On Hold)

A prototype idea I had for the North America Google Developer Groups On Campus Solution Challenge 2025, based on the following task:-

Develop a system for real-time indexing and keyword search of thousands of concurrent live audio streams, enabling near-instant discovery of spoken content. The solution must achieve high accuracy and low latency while remaining scalable and cost-effective, supporting interactive features like live comments, tipping, and call-ins for live audio broadcasts and conversations.

Currently on hold due to other commitments but plan to complete this prototype in the future.
